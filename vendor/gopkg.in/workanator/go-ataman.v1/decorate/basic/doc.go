/*
Package basic defines basic decoration style. The style introduces those rules.

 - Tags are enclosed in `<` and `>`.
 - Attributes and modifiers are concatenated with `+`.
 - Multiple attributes are delimited with `,`.

Examples:

 `<yellow,bg+blue>` - Green text on blue background.
 `<bold,bg+intensive+cyan>` - Bold text on high intensive cyan background.
